It subsided a few days after I applied acyclovir topically. It came back a couple of times after that.  But it also subsided without any intervention.  It is dark purple in color.  Have tingling pain after the blister is poked open. Never happen in winter.  It relapsed last month. It appeared on the outer side of the pelvis when starting, and subsided a few days later.  It is coming back these days, and at the edge of the ribs.  There is no improvement after using acyclovir.  May I ask experts here if this is herpes zoster or pompholyx?  I went to the hospital today to get a routine blood test and C-reactive protein.  They revealed no problem.  The physician said it is mite infection, and prescribed Valacyclovir, Loratadine, and topically drugs to protect skin and mucosa.  I don\\u2019t feel good with this diagnosis and use of medicines.
